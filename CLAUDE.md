# CLAUDE.md — VC portfolio datasets & scrapers

Guidance for working in this repo. Read this first; deeper build methodology is in
[`scripts/PLAYBOOK.md`](scripts/PLAYBOOK.md).

## What this repo is
Structured JSON datasets of VC firms' portfolio companies, plus the reusable Python
scrapers that produce them. Each dataset is one JSON array, one object per company.

**Firms verified to publish NO portfolio on their own site** (no dataset possible under the
no-third-party-sources rule): Benchmark, Thrive Capital, DST Global, Tiger Global, Altimeter,
Sutter Hill Ventures, Greenoaks. Each was exhaustively checked (sitemaps, guessed paths,
embedded JS) — their sites are minimal brochures / gated LP portals.

**Network note (2026-07-01):** this machine intermittently cannot route to Webflow's current
CDN IP (`cdn.webflow.com` → 198.202.211.1). Affected scrapers (`parkway`, `khosla`, `spark`,
`oakhcft`, `8vc`, `lux`, `dragoneer`, also existing `rre`/`iconiq`) implement a fallback chain:
direct HTTPS → legacy-IP pin (75.2.70.75) → `r.jina.ai` read-only relay of the same page. On a
healthy network they use the direct route. Datasets fetched relay-only at build time: 8VC, Lux,
Dragoneer, Spark (spot-checked correct; re-run to refresh when routing is healthy). Afore
(`afore_companies.json`, added 2026-07-22) was transcribed from afore.vc's own portfolio page via
a read-only fetch relay for the same reason — its `afore_scraper.py` carries the standard
direct→legacy-IP→r.jina.ai fallback chain and re-derives straight from the source HTML on a
healthy network (verify the Finsweet card selectors against live markup on the first clean re-run).

```
Scripts resolve `../data` relative to their own file, so run from the repo root:
`python3 scripts/usv_scraper.py` (writes `data/usv_companies.json`). Each scraper has a
`--limit N` flag for quick test runs. Deps: `pip install requests beautifulsoup4`.

## Core principles (do not violate)
- **Site-tailored schema.** Only include fields the source actually exposes. Don't force
  every firm into the same shape; each `*_companies.json` has its own field set.
- **Never fabricate.** Missing scalar → `null`; missing list → `[]`. If the site doesn't
  publish it, leave it empty.
- **`scraped_at`** = the real run timestamp (ISO-8601 UTC). If genuinely unknown, `null` —
  never a guessed/today's date passed off as the scrape time. (Lightspeed `companies.json`
  has `scraped_at = null` for this reason.)
- **No Crunchbase / LinkedIn / PitchBook / investor databases.** External enrichment is
  Wikidata-only (see below).
- Most empty cells are **legitimately N/A** (e.g. exit/acquirer/ticker for active
  companies; sector when the firm never tags it). That is not "missing data" to invent.
- **Empty ≠ absent.** Before declaring a field N/A, check whether the data is *denormalized*
  into the **name suffix** (`Foo (Acquired)`, `Bar (NYSE: TICK)`) or **description prose**
  ("Acquired by X in YYYY"). A structured field that's empty for *every* record is a cue to
  go look there, not proof the site omits it. (See PLAYBOOK §Recon "Empty ≠ absent".)

## `everywhere_tags` taxonomy (exactly these 17 — verbatim spelling)
```
BioTech
Health
Cybersecurity
Dev Tools / Cloud
Consumer
Future of Work
Transportation / Mobility
FinTech / Insurance
RegTech/Gov/Legal
Deeptech / Robotics / AR/VR
Data & Analytics
Logistics / Supply Chain
Web3 / Crypto
PropTech
Gaming / Media / Entertainment
CPG
Climate / Sustainability
```
Rules:
- **AI alone is not a category** — classify an AI company by the *market it serves*
  (AI for devs → Dev Tools / Cloud; for work → Future of Work; for health → Health; etc.).
- Include a **vertical + enabling-tech** tag only when both clearly apply (e.g. health data
  → `Health` + `Data & Analytics`); if one is much weaker, drop it.
- Don't use **Consumer** or **Future of Work** as catch-alls.
- Order most→least relevant; **cap at 4**; no duplicates; every value must be one of the 17.
- Derive from the firm's own sector tags first (when present), else keyword-classify the
  name + description. Tagging is keyword-based (no LLM) and intentionally coarse — a few
  untagged stragglers / over-tags are acceptable.

## Enrichment (`scripts/enrich.py`)
Back-fills empty fields in `companies.json`, `menlo_companies.json`, `usv_companies.json`
from **Wikidata** (free + attributable):
- **Fills ONLY empty fields; never overwrites** a non-empty value.
- Matches a company to its Wikidata item by **verified official-website (P856) domain** —
  ambiguous name-only matches are skipped (prevents wrong data).
- Pulls founders (P112), founding year (P571), industry→sectors (P452), ticker (P414/P249).
- Records every fill + source Q-id in `data/enrichment_report.json`.
- Coverage is partial by design (well-known companies match; long-tail private startups
  won't). Re-runnable and idempotent.

## Conventions
- Politeness: custom User-Agent, timeouts, retries/back-off, small sleeps between requests.
- **Remote: `https://github.com/ruszinn/vc-comp` (public).** Since 2026-07-01 the GitHub
  CLI (`gh`) is installed and authenticated as `ruszinn`, and `origin` is configured —
  `git push` works. The old drag-drop upload workflow is retired.
- **Commit and push only when the user asks.** Use a concise message; end with a
  co-author trailer for the current Claude model, e.g.
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`. Commits use
  `git -c user.email="ruszinfilay@gmail.com" -c user.name="rus.perish"`.
- Use `/tmp` (or the session scratchpad) for recon HTML/temp files, not the repo.

## Quickstart: add a new VC firm
1. Recon the portfolio page (`curl` raw HTML; identify the data source). See PLAYBOOK §Recon.
2. Write `scripts/<firm>_scraper.py` following the shared template (PLAYBOOK §Template);
   output `data/<firm>_companies.json` with a site-tailored schema + `everywhere_tags`.
3. Test with `--limit`, then full run; validate (PLAYBOOK §Validation).
4. Optionally `python3 scripts/enrich.py` (add the file to its list) to Wikidata-fill gaps.
